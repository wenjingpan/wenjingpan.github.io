		<h2>Wenjing's primary interests lie in the areas of social interaction, communication network, communication technology, and health.</h2>
	</header>
	
	  <p>The research I have conducted so far has focused on online supportive communication; specifically, it has aimed to (a) investigate the processes through with people exchange social support and health information online; (b) how communication networks helps to generate social capital and improve health outcomes for online support forum users; (c) examine how new media and technology facilitate or impede the successful exchange of social support and health information; and (d) incorporate computational social science (e.g., web-scrape, social network analysis, log data analysis, computerized text analysis) into the study of supportive communication.</p>
			<p>I am experienced in quantitative analysis and emperical research methods including experiments, surveys, and social network analysis</p>

			<h3>Communication, &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; &amp; Status Development</h3>
			<p>[<strong>Dissertation Project</strong>] The study investigates status development in collaborative decision-making groups that involve potential status contest. The focus is the following mediation: Visual status signaling leads to physiological stress responses, which in turn affects deference and status development. The goal of this study is to identify an affective mechanism (i.e., stress experience) of status development in task- and collective-oriented groups. Status development in such groups has been predominantly studied from a perspective that emphasizes group processes and judgment of task-specific competence or value to a group. &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; on the other hand, has been studied in relation to social status in human and primate groups, but not systematically examined in task- and collective-oriented settings that also involve status hierarchy. The present study attempts to address this issue.</p>

			<h3>&lsquo;Group Talk,&rsquo; Emotions, &amp; Self-Organized Solidarity</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//blogs.cornell.edu/margolin/people">Dr. Margolin</a>] The communication logics that spur self-organized collective action are not well-understood. We argue that two evolutionary predispositions—human group-mindedness and social functionalities of discrete emotions—contribute to a phenomenon we call &lsquo;group talk&rsquo; where group identifiers outwardly discuss their group and, by doing so, increase self-organized solidarity. We test this communication logic among professional football fans who are repeatedly exposed to intergroup competition outcomes that, for them, are quasi-randomized. We find that competition outcomes induce differential expressions of emotions in group talk, which stimulate (positivity, anger) or suppress (sadness) further group talk, triggering a self-sustaining tendency over a full week. Implications are discussed regarding group talk’s socio-emotional functionality for self-organization in contemporary collective action.</p>
